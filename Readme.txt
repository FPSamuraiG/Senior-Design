Project Abstract:

In this project, we designed a prototype input collection system for use in interactive electronic systems in saltwater animal enclosures. Increasing interactivity in enclosures has the potential to improve animal welfare and allow for research and behavior monitoring. Implementing an input device underwater is made difficult by the lack of premade input devices that function underwater, waterproofing requirements, and the ineffectiveness of wireless communication methods underwater. To address these challenges, we designed a prototype input system that includes a custom submersible pushbutton, fiber optic communication, wirelessly rechargeable battery, and extensive waterproofing features. This prototype functions as a pushbutton that can be installed underwater and connected to an Arduino through a fiber optic cable. It provides a tactile input for animals while maintaining safety by not exposing wires or electronics to water. Although it only functions as a pushbutton in its current state, this prototype was designed to be easy to use and easy to add additional sensors or input devices to. Overall, it meets the basic needs presented by our advisors while also making future work and improvements easier.
